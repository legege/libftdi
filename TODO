*** TODO for 1.0 release ***
Build related:
- Rename the library and header file,
  so libftdi 0.x and 1.x can co-exist

API extentions:
- TO DECIDE: Make ftdi structure opaque?

Misc:
- Resolve TODO entries in ftdi_eeprom
- Look into merging ftdi_eeprom and examples/eeprom
- "To deal with ftdi_context"  <-- Xiaofan: What was meant by this?
  Maybe the same as "Make ftdi structure opaque?"
